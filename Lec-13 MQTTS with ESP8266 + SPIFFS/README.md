This example demonstrates how we can connect to a Secure MQTT Broker using SSL. 
An SSL Certificate file for Mosquitto Server is provided in the .Der format. 
We will utilize the ESP8266 FileSystem Known as SPIFFS to upload this certificate to our 
ESP826 memory. 

We will then use this certificate to Connect to secure Mosquitto Broker over Port 8883.
